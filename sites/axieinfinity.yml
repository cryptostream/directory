  Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-style blockchain game with more than 250,000 daily active players. It is being developed by Sky Mavis, a technology-focused game studio founded in early 2018 and headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The game is available for all devices on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android platforms and allows participants to earn tokens through skillful gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem.
  Axie Infinity is a new type of game where users and the team are coworking to develop the network. Its goal is to introduce blockchain technology to the world in a fun way. The game is intended to become a fully decentralized platform governed by the community. This is planned to be achieved by distributing AXS (the game token) among players and stakers decreasing the Sky Mavis ownership concentration over time. The final purpose of the Axie team is to create an application connecting players with the entire Axie Infinity universe.
  All of Axie's artistic assets and genetic data can be accessed by external third parties, allowing community developers to create their own tools, artworks, characters, and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe. To provide security the company’s AXS and SLP ERC-20 contract has been audited by Quantstamp.
