  Swap, earn, stack yields, lend, borrow, leverage all on one decentralized,
  community driven platform. Welcome home to DeFi.
  SushiSwap is a clear-cut example of the so-called AMM. This abbreviation stands for the automated market maker, a decentralized exchange (DEX) which is able to create a market for any pair of tokens.
  Launched on August 28, 2020, as a UniSwap’s hard fork on Ethereum blockchain it immediately conquered the crypto world with 1.4 billion USD market capitalization dragged from UniSwap.
  SushiSwap added some new features to the usual AMM model of decentralized exchange such as revenue-sharing, larger rewarding pools and therefore higher rewards for participants, and development based on community decisions. But the main advantages are the in-house token SUSHI adding and handing total control to its holders. SushiSwap’s aim is to change the AMM market increasing the users’ influence on its development.
